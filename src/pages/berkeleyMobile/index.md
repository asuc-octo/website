  title: What is Berkeley Mobile?
  description: >-
    The Berkeley Mobile Application has a plethora features, including Bear Transit routes and live tracking, dining hall menus (including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night menus for all dining halls), schedules for all of our public athletic facilities, and hours for every library on campus. We believe that the application is an absolute necessity for the busy Berkeley Student.
