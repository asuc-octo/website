  title: What We Do
  description: >-
    The ASUC Office of the CTO was founded in Spring of 2014 with one goal in mind: to easily and efficiently provide quality software to Berkeley students and staff. We strive to help our fellow students more efficiently navigate Berkeley’s complex bureaucracy, and allow them to better manage their safety.


    As a full-fledged division of the ASUC with over 30 talented members, we work to improve the campus experience for everybody. Our team works on everything from Android, iOS, and back-end development to marketing and product management.
